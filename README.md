## Datasets

- **ShipsEar: An underwater vessel noise database** *[[PDF]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apacoust.2016.06.008) [[Sample]](http://atlanttic.uvigo.es/underwaternoise/)*

  The database is currently composed of 90 records representing sounds from background noise and 11 vessel types  including *fishing boats, trawlers, mussel boats, tugboats, dredgers, motorboats, pilot boats, sailboats, passenger ferries, ocean liners, ro-ro vessels*. 

  The sounds are recorded in shallow waters and in real conditions, which consist of about 3 hours recordings. Therefore, the recordings contain both natural and anthropogenic environment noise. It aims to provide a database of real sounds that researchers can use, for example, to train boat detectors and classifiers, usable in monitoring maritime traffic.

- **DeepShip: An underwater acoustic benchmark dataset and a separable convolution based autoencoder for classification** *[[PDF]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115270) [[Sample]](https://github.com/irfankamboh/DeepShip)*

  *Muhammad Irfan et al* construct and present an underwater acoustic dataset, named DeepShip, which consists of 47 h and 4 min of real world underwater recordings of 265 different ships belong to four classes (*Tug, Cargo, Oil Tanker, Passenger Ship*). The proposed dataset includes recording from throughout the year with different sea states and noise levels.
